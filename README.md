## What it is

A basic warmup exercise. Simple, practice oriented, clone of the Netflix Homepage. Built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts
- [Awesomeness](https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Programming) - Strictly for the love of coding :-)

## What it does

- Look pretty, that's about it :-)

## Learning Points

- CSS Grid
- Styling Tables
<!-- - Tabs with Javascript -->
- Positioning

## Installation
Installation of my project is very simple. 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/chakitg/bingeflix.git
```
This will clone the repository in your local device.

Then we need to change the directory.

```bash
  cd bingeflix
```

Then type "code ." to open it in VS Code (or any other IDE).
```bash
  code .
```

Then Go live with your IDE.

BOOM!! There you have it.

## Some Cool Stuff

> (Just a thought), You could advance this by adding some animations to the selector borders etc.

## Features in Development

I might add the other pages on the Netflix website if I ever come back to refactor ^-^
